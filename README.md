# Process 
My process for creating my portfolio was to have a simplified layout that showed my strengths in web development and photography. Starting by creating each page first, following the prototype layout while adhereing to accessibility standards. I wanted to make sure that my work was easy to read and view and that it was responsive on desktop and mobile applications. Once the pages were laid out I then started building the css so that it was to the standard I had set out in my prototype. 

# Challenges
Some challenges I faced while creating my portfolio were working with bootstrap to ensure a smooth process while also desiging to my specific prototype. Using bootstrap and then having to customize around it and prove difficult since the framework is specific but taking the time to view the dev tools and use css variables to change the design solved the problems I had. 

# Learned
While creating my portfolio I've learned how to include and use different frameworks so that the process of creating a website is easier and helpful to design layout specific sections. Also learning how to add css libraries so that your website can use different animation libraries to make the website more appealing to the user.
